# PlaygroundWorkspace

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.3.

## Description

This project is a playground for me to test out new features and ideas in Angular. It is a work in progress and will be updated.
There are a few things that I have created so far:

- Demo app used to test my-first-web-component (src)
- MyFirstWebComponent - A simple web component that displays a message, input and button
- MyFirstWebComponentBundler - Bundles the MyFirstWebComponent into a single component

## Building the project

To build the project, you will need to run the following commands:

- `npm install` - This will install all the dependencies for the project
- `npm run build:my-first-web-component` - This will build the MyFirstWebComponent
- `npm run build:my-first-web-component-builder` - This will build the MyFirstWebComponentBundler
- `npm run package:my-first-web-component-lib` - This will package the MyFirstWebComponent into a library

or you can run `npm run create:my-first-web-component-lib` to complete these commands at once.

## Running the project in Production-like way

To run the project, you will need to run the following commands:

- `npm run http-server` - This will start the demo app (simple html) with the MyFirstWebComponent created as a web component.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
